        <p>Physics degree entry requirements
            To study physics at university, it is likely that you’ll be required to have completed secondary-level qualifications (such as A-levels) in both physics and mathematics. An advanced mathematics qualification (such as ‘further’ or ‘higher’ mathematics) and an additional science, such as chemistry, may also aid your application.
            
            Those who study physics will graduate in three or four years with a Bachelor of Science (BSc). Some universities offer the option to continue studying for an additional one or two years, graduating with a Master of Physics (MPhys) or a Master of Science (MSci). Alternatively a separate master’s program may be applied for after completing the bachelor’s degree.</p>
