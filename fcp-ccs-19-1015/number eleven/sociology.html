        <h6>SOCIOLOGY</h6>
        <p>Sociology is a social science which helps to make sense of the way society works. Those who study sociology will become adept in understanding and analyzing sociological issues and devising potential solutions and improvements, perhaps by addressing social inequalities relating to factors such as class, gender, race and poverty.

            Sociologists look at the far reaches of human society both past and present, gaining insight into how societies develop and organize themselves. Topics covered on a sociology degree can be incredibly wide-ranging depending on your interests. Sociology students will learn about the social causes and consequences of common human experiences and issues. This knowledge can then be used across multiple sectors, from politics to social welfare.</p>
