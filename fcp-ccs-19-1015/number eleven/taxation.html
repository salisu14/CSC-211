        <h4>TAXATION</h4>
        <P>Taxation courses are available at the bachelor's and master's degree levels in programs such as finance, accounting, economics and auditing. Some taxation courses are offered individually to people who want to learn more about tax laws for personal enrichment, or as professional certification courses for people who want to work for tax preparation companies.

            Here is an outline of common concepts taught in taxation courses:
            
            Cost accounting
            Financial reporting
            Public resources and expenditures
            Income deductions and credits
            International tax policy
            Business taxes
            For students who want to become certified public accountants (CPAs), a bachelor's degree and a state-issued licensing exam is required. Master's degrees in taxation prepare students for independent tax careers or roles within private business and government sectors.
