            <p style="text-align: justify;">A multiprogramming operating system may run many programs on a single processor computer. If one program must wait for an input/output transfer in a multiprogramming operating system, the other programs are ready to use the CPU. As a result, various jobs may share CPU time. However, the execution of their jobs is not defined to be at the same time period.
                When a program is being performed, it is known as a "Task", "Process", and "Job". Concurrent program executions improve system resource consumption and throughput as compared to serial and batch processing systems <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The primary goal of multiprogramming is to manage the entire system's resources. The key components of a multiprogramming system are the file system, command processor, transient area, and I/O control system. As a result, multiprogramming operating systems are designed to store different programs based on sub-segmenting parts of the transient area. The resource management routines are linked with the operating system core functions.</p>
