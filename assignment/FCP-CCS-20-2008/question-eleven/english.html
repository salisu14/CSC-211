                <b>About the Course:</b>
                <p>The Department of English and Literary Studies is one of the eleven departments that came into being following the establishment of the University in 2011. It had as its pioneer Head, Professor Joseph Sunday Aliyu who served for two academic sessions. The department, at the initial stage, seeks to give attention to the three broad aspects of literary studies-language, literature and drama- thereby awarding the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in English and Literary Studies. It is expected that the department will eventually evolve to award three distinct degrees in these broad areas of study. In this case, students majoring in English Language will be exposed dominantly to the general structure of human language and in particular to the English language. They will also be exposed to the various branches of linguistics or language studies. Similarly, students majoring in Literature will be exposed to contemporary forms.ï¿½ To the same extent, majors in language will have training in the theories and practice of drama and theatre studies. Besides these core foci, the department will seek to engender creativity and the dynamic deployment of the skills to be imparted to the students for the resolution of the practical and knowledge issues of the Nigerian nation as well as participate actively as members of the global community of knowledge holders.</p>
