                <b>About the Course:</b>
                <p>The department of Criminology and Security studies started as an independent department that was carved out of Sociology department in 2014, in response to the national demand for a specialised discipline that try to solve the nationâ€™s fledging crime rate. Human society faces new and increasing threats from different dimensions ranging from terrorism to vandalism. This is mainly due to serious security lapses and increasingly sophisticated organized criminals. As a result, most security, defence, law-enforcement agencies (both home and abroad) and organizations embodying key security functions require a paradigm shift in training that impart new skills and knowledge to enable security personnel to deal with contemporary security challenges. Rapid internally and externally induced changes spurred by globalization in security sector require new approach to security management which in turn demand appropriate training on a wide range of issues; such as managing risks, securing institutional assets and buildings; information and data protection. It is in this context therefore, that the department presents the Bachelor of Science in Criminology and Security Studies. The Department was created to meet the national needs on capacity building in the police, prison and private security firms and in response to keep crime and criminal behaviour at the lowest ebb. The course is also intended to meet the national need of guaranteed security by training resource persons capable of taking up leadership in security management systems within government, corporate sector, and private security agencies. Security is an important component of national development and a necessity for realization of national goals.</p>
