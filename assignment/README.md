2. Create a static web page which defines all text formatting tags of HTML in tabular format.
3. Create a webpage using list tags of HTML.
4. Create webpage to include image using HTML tag.
5. Create employee registration webpage using HTML form objects.
6. Create an HTML file (e.g. first_page.html) that specifies a page that contains a heading and two
paragraphs of text. Use the HTML tags <h1>, </h1>, <p> and </p> in this exercise. As the texts in the
heading and paragraphs you can use any texts you like.
* Add an unordered list to this web page. An unordered list should look like the following when
it is shown by a browser:
* An unordered list can be specified with the tags <ul> and </ul>.
* An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be specified
with tags <li> and </li>.
* After you have created your unordered list, check out what happens when you
convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags <ul> and </ul> with <ol> and
</ol>, respectively.
* Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the <img> tag. As an image, you
can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the Internet.
7. Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs. You could name this new
file another_page.html, and you should place it into the same folder where your first .html is. After
you have created the new .html page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load
another_page.html when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use the
<a> and </a> tags in this exercise. Inside the tag <a> you need to use a href attribute that specifies
which page will be loaded when the link is clicked.
8. HTML tags like <a> can have certain attributes. The href attribute is mandatory in the <a> tag.
Additionally it is possible to use the title attribute which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse
cursor is moved above a link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in
the previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when the mouse cursor is
over the link.
9. It is possible to use a picture (image) as a link. Modify your page so that the picture that is on your
page will also serve as a link that leads to another page.
